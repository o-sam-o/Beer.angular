# Beer.angular

**Work in progress ....**

Overview
--------
[Angular](http://angularjs.org/) backed rendering of my [Flickr beer collection](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cavenagh/sets/72157625277593652/with/9631336651/).  

This project originally started as an Angular port of [Beer.backbone](https://www.github.com/o-sam-o/Beer.backbone) 
but I changed the focus a little to ensure optimal performance on mobile 
devices and experiment with technologies such as local storage and web workers.

The Premise
-----------
Create a photographic collection of beer bottles (ideally that I have drunk).
While I try to ensure the label is readable, image quality is not a priority.
Most photos are taken with my phone and often in poor lighting conditions.
The same beer is allowed to feature multiple times in the collection if there is some kind
of variation in the bottle.
